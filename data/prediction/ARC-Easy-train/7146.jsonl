A thermal plume can be 12-18\u00b0C warmer than surrounding waters. Although some fish may be attracted to the warmer water, other organisms may not be able to survive. Government officials order a study to determine the effects of a thermal plume in a water body near a nuclear power plant in North Carolina. Which factor most related to temperature should the study focus on in order to determine whether the thermal plume is damaging the health of the water system?", "candidate_answers": "(A) pH (B) dissolved oxygen (C) nutrient concentration (D) turbidity", "answer": "pH", "label": "A", "answerKey": "B"}
